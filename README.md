# OrchestrAI

OrchestrAI is an web application that transforms text prompts into playable, viewable, and editable music compositions. Leveraging OpenAI's API with GPT-4 Turbo model, OrchestrAI offers a unique platform for users to generate music in ABC notation format directly from textual descriptions. It is likely the first public AI application that can create playable music in staff music notation from text prompts.

## Features

-   **Music Generation:** Convert text prompts into ABC music notation using OpenAI's API.
-   **ABCJS Rendering:** View, listen to, and edit generated music notations with an in-browser staff music notation renderer.
-   **JuxCompose:** Compare multiple ABC notation tunes side-by-side.
